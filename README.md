# Python_homework

This is a compilation of homework codes of Pic16-Python class at UCLA

HW1:
A simple program of Newton's Method. Finding one root of a polynomial with a starting point.

HW2F:
A test program of execution time of different functions/methods (list comprehension vs. for loop vs. map; lambda function vs. regular function; modify existing list vs. append to a new list

HW3:
A self-written MathVector class functions like built-in Vector class. Magic methods (addtion,multiplication,[] and etc.) are defined.

HW4W:
Read unordered data (name, phone) from one file and write organized data into another file using regular expression to catch certain structures.

HW5M:
A program of animation using PyQt5. A red ball is able to bounce inside the window with certain speed. It works even if the window is resized during runtime.

HW5W:
A rectangle that can be dragged with the mouse and users can change its color by double clicking the rectangle. (Practice of mouse events)

HW6M:
Create a math calculator GUI with Qt Designer. It is able to process python style math commands (^ works as well!) and print the output to the console.

HW6F:
Learn to process images using numpy arrays including combining two images, removing green background and finding (and visualizing) differences between two similar images.

HW7F:
Learn to process audios using Fast Fourier Transform (from SciPy). The code is able to remove the "woo guy" from a superbowl game (remove certain frequency from an audio).

HW8W:
Find the maximum area that can be enclosed by a curve with a given length l using scipy.optimize.minimize. Answer is a circle.

HW9M:
Utilize scipy.integrate.odeint to solve for higher order ODEs. The code uses Motions of Pendulum as an example showing how to solve the second order ordinary differential equation by writing them as two first order ODEs.
